            Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evilâ€”what more could any reader ask for in one book? 
            The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. 
            But Lewis did not stop there. 
            Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia
