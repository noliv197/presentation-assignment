            The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the Foundation series
        </p>
        <p>
            For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. 
            Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, 
            can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. 
            To preserve knowledge and save humankind, 
            Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. 
            He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.
