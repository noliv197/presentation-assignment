            One of my favorite hobbys of all time is reading. 
            <br>
            I felt in love with it when I read my first Agatha Christie mystery, and since then I try to explore all kind of genres, but mystery is definitely my favorite one.
            <br>
            I separated a few books that have "somehow left me with a very good impression".
